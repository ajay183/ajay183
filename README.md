I was curious to understand, "Why would some recruiters make it mandatory to add a note and some don't?"

The curiosity of trying to understand why people do what they do and understanding what could I have done to make life of sender and receiver easy and effective, correlates my actions towards being an passionate product manager. 

I have keen interests in quantitative research and experimenting with the possible solutions to the hypothesis generated out of research. 

Over the years I have developed critical listening and problem solving skills which I have gained being a founder myself and now within large organisations. 

Evolving is my key hobby and I have keen interests in technology and long rides with my lovely bike. Also, I invest my part time in understanding machines that I ride to maximise performance.
